= SwitchFileFeature =

This feature is a function mapped to the shortcut (Ctrl-Alt-X) which allows you to switch back and forth between a tapestry template file and a tapestry component file. E.g you can switch from WizardPage.java to WizardPage.tml. Further characteristics are:

* a file which is being switched to will be opened in case it wasn't before
* the default ending of .tml can be changed on the preferences page to .html
