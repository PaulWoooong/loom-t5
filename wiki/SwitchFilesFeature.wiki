= SwitchFilesFeature =

This feature is a function which can be found in the navigate menubar (Navigate > Go To > Switch to Template/JavaFile) which allows you to switch back and forth between a tapestry template file and a tapestry component file. 
E.g you can switch from `WizardPage.java` to `WizardPage.tml` 

Further characteristics are:

  * a file which is being switched to will be opened in case it wasn't before
  * the default ending of .tml can be changed on the Preferences page to .html
  * *this action can be triggered by the shortcut Ctrl-Alt-x*
